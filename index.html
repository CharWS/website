            My Garden
        </h2>
        <p><em>by Ralph Waldo Emerson</em></p>
        <i><p>
        If I could put my woods in song
        And tell what's there enjoyed,
        All men would to my gardens throng,
        And leave the cities void.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        In my plot no tulips blow,--
        Snow-loving pines and oaks instead;
        And rank the savage maples grow
        From Spring's faint flush to Autumn red.  
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        My garden is a forest ledge
        Which older forests bound;
        The banks slope down to the blue lake-edge,
        Then plunge to depths profound.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        Here once the Deluge ploughed,
        Laid the terraces, one by one;
        Ebbing later whence it flowed,
        They bleach and dry in the sun.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        The sowers made haste to depart,--
        The wind and the birds which sowed it;
        Not for fame, nor by rules of art,
        Planted these, and tempests flowed it.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        Waters that wash my garden-side
        Play not in Nature's lawful web,
        They heed not moon or solar tide,--
        Five years elapse from flood to ebb.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        Hither hasted, in old time, Jove,
        And every god,--none did refuse;
        And be sure at last came Love,
        And after Love, the Muse.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        Keen ears can catch a syllable,
        As if one spake to another,
        In the hemlocks tall, untamable,
        And what the whispering grasses smother.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        Aeolian harps in the pine
        Ring with the song of the Fates;
        Infant Bacchus in the vine,--
        Far distant yet his chorus waits.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        Canst thou copy in verse one chime
        Of the wood-bell's peal and cry,
        Write in a book the morning's prime,
        Or match with words that tender sky?
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        Wonderful verse of the gods,
        Of one import, of varied tone;
        They chant the bliss of their abodes
        To man imprisoned in his own.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        Ever the words of the gods resound;
        But the porches of man's ear
        Seldom in this low life's round
        Are unsealed, that he may hear.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        Wandering voices in the air
        And murmurs in the wold
        Speak what I cannot declare,
        Yet cannot all withhold.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        When the shadow fell on the lake,
        The whirlwind in ripples wrote
        Air-bells of fortune that shine and break,
        And omens above thought.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        But the meanings cleave to the lake,
        Cannot be carried in book or urn;
        Go thy ways now, come later back,
        On waves and hedges still they burn.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        These the fates of men forecast,
        Of better men than live to-day;
        If who can read them comes at last
        He will spell in the sculpture, 'Stay.'
