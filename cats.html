        <h3>Summer (2005-2023)</h3>
        <p>
            <img
            class="fit-picture"
            src="./assets/images/cats/summer/summer-window.jpg"/>
            Summer was my first cat. She was adopted from the animal shelter who had picked her up as a stray. 
            She had a litter of kittens before I got her. She was always very independent and loved going outside to hunt. 
            Had to put a cowbell on her to alert the birds. She was also shy but once she got to know a person was very cuddly and liked bellyrubs best.
        </p>
        <h3>Cowgirl (2006-2022)</h3>
        <p>
            <img 
            class="fit-picture"
            src="./assets/images/cats/cg/cg-backdoor.jpg"/>
            Cowgirl was adopted later by my mom. She came from the same animal shelter as Summer, 
            but she was surrendered by her previous owners. When we got her she had been declawed both front and back which no-one should do to their cats. 
            We never let her go outside because of her lack of claws. She was extremely social and liked meeting new people and especially smelling things.

        <h3>Bill (2024-Current)</h3>
        <p>
            <img
            class="fit-picture"
            src="./assets/images/cats/bill/bill.jpg"/>
            Not much is known about the history of Bill and Ted but they are brothers from the same litter, they had a 3rd sibling who was adopted before them. Bill had a hard start to life with some health issues and a tapeworm which we think is part of why he's smaller. He's very smart and curious about the world, and also quite friendly and sociable with people. Bill likes to sleep on his back when he's fully comfortable, and he can get a bit too worked up when petted causing some nibbling.
        </p>
        <h3>Ted (2024-Current)</h3>
        <p>
            <img
            class="fit-picture"
            src="./assets/images/cats/ted/ted.jpg"/>
            Ted is just as curious as his brother but tends to be the one who ends up getting in trouble. He likes to sit around and hang out, and he doesn't mind vigorous petting and scratches, he especially loves getting brushed which is great because of his long fur needing more maintenance.
