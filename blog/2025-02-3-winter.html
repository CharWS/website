    <p>Work on the raised bed continues now that the snow has thawed, should be able to do final assembly and installation in the next few weeks. Will have to get some rocks and soil to fill it, rocks on the bottom to ensure good drainage.</p>
    <!--Todo: add some pictures of the raised bed-->
    <p>Seeds have been purchased and acquired for the coming spring. I'm going to plant more clover seeds as cover crop this year. Got lots of good brassicas and some new things I haven't grown before. The broccoli I tried last fall but didn't get it in the ground in time so it didn't get to finish before winter hit. Will be starting the early seeds indoors and moving them outside weather permitting.
        <ul>
            <h2>Early seeds (to plant by March)</h2>
            <li>Mustard greens</li>
            <li>Hardy purple broccoli</li>
            <li>Snow peas</li>
            <li>Japanese mibuna (got these for free from the seed co.)</li>
            <li>Early bok choy</li>
        </ul>
